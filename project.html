    <h3 class="details">You work for a creative agency and you just got an urgent brief for design work from a client, itâ€™s 5 pm on a Thursday - so end of the day. Your designer is already swamped with other projects and has a full plate, on top of which he has to leave immediately to go visit his sick mother at his village. If the client requires the urgent design work by first thing Saturday morning, what would you do in this situation?</h3>
